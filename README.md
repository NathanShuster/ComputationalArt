# ComputationalArt
This is the base repository for the computational art mini project for Software Design.

It generates a series of functions used to create images, stored in the images folder.
The images are then combined into a single video, called "my_art.mp4".

Dependencies:
Python 2.7
PIL library

I used Anaconda for python and then used homebrew to install the PIL library.

To Run:
On Mac OSX, navigate to the directory and run 'python recursive_art.py'
